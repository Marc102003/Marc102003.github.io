Target user profile:
With this project, I aimed to create a resume in a simple and visually appealing manner. Using Figma, I found an intuitive and easy-to-use tool that allows me to highlight my skills, work experience, and education. My user profile has primarily focused on updating my resume to reflect my current journey.

Information architecture:
Since this project focuses on creating a resume in Figma, information architecture is not a relevant element in this context. The Figma design platform provides us with an intuitive and flexible interface that allows us to create and organize content freely.

Visual design:
To visually design this project, a color palette reflecting professionalism and modernity will be used. I have employed a combination of neutral tones such as white and black, along with accents of a subtle color like blue, which adds a touch of freshness and vitality.

Regarding typography, I have used a clean and readable sans-serif font, in this case, Montserrat. This font is ideal for presenting information clearly and professionally.

As for the page layout, I aimed for a clean and organized structure that facilitates resume navigation and editing. I have divided the content into well-defined sections, such as Languages, Work Experience, Education, Skills, etc. This allows me to organize my information effectively and highlight my strengths.

For inspiration, I have reviewed similar projects on design platforms and online portfolios. I have also watched YouTube videos to get an idea of what constitutes good design.
